# Handle After

```{rst-class} lead
Handle requests after the current handler.
```

```{note}
Middleware uses {class}`~contextvars.ContextVar` to store state per thread or async
tasks.
```

## Usage

Postpone marked requests handling until after the current handler has finished.

This is useful for dispatching requests from inside a transactional context. The middleware will pause proceessing Â the middleware chain further and return. Proceessing the middleware chain will resume after the current request finishes.

The result of any postponed handlers will not be accessible.

### Registration

Add the middleware to your bus.  

```py
bus = (
    banshee.builder()
    .with_middleware(banshee.HandleAfterMiddleware())
    .with_locator(registry)
    .build()
)
```

### Context

You trigger this middleware with the HandleAfter context.

```py
bus.handle(request, contexts=[banshee.HandleAfter()])
```
